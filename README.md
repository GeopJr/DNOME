## Info

This is a Discord theme inspired by GNOME's default theme, Adwaita, in an attempt to make Discord look like it's part of the environment.

The theme is written in Less and supports both light and dark mode. There's a few config options in [./src/DNOME.less](./src/DNOME.less). If you are looking to recolor it, you can do so by modifying the Less/CSS variables found in [./src/modules/variables/](./src/modules/variables/).

The theme might be missing styles on elements that I don't have access to (Nitro) or are new (app directory) or changed class names. Please open an issue if you find any.

## Screenshots

## Installing

You can inject it using [Crycord](https://github.com/GeopJr/Crycord), [BeauitfulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord), [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp), [Powercord](https://powercord.dev/) & any other CSS injector available.

There are 3 options for obtaining the theme:

1. [DNOME-latest.css](./DNOME-latest.css), which imports the latest compiled version.
2. [dist/DNOME.css](https://github.com/GeopJr/DNOME/blob/dist/DNOME.css), which is the latest compiled version.
3. [Compile it yourself](#Compiling).

> Some client mods require special metadata. The theme is in its simplest form.
>
> However, if you feel something needs extra instructions, open an issue and I'll list it below.
>
> Keep in mind that many plugins and elements from them might not be styled.

### For BetterDiscord

BetterDiscord requires a non-CSS META tag and a specific suffix on the filename. There are 2 options for installing the theme:

1. Download [./DNOME.theme.css](./DNOME.theme.css) and place it in your `themes/` folder.
2. Copy paste the contents of the desired file in the `Custom CSS` section in settings.

## Compiling

## Web

You can compile DNOME from your browser!

Visit https://dnome.queer.software/ and follow the instructions.

## Manually

- Install [Less](https://lesscss.org/)
- Run one of the following commands:

```
$ make less
or
$ lessc ./src/DNOME.less ./dist/DNOME.css
```
- Done, the theme should be available at `./dist/DNOME.css`

### GTK Themes

You can use colors from your current GTK theme by running:

```
$ make gtk
or
$ node gtk/grab_theme_colors.mjs
```

and then compiling DNOME again.

> **Warning**
> Manually set your Discord theme in settings to the one matching your GTK theme (Dark/Light). DNOME doesn't override everything on Discord but rather enhance it.
